# TIL: Today I Learned

A daily commit repository for my self-initiated web development study. May contain contents outside the realms of web development. 

Heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/milooy/TIL">@milloy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/til">thoughtbot til</a>.

<h1>TIL Rules</h1>

<ol>
  <li>All contents must be in English only.</li>
  <li>Make folders under the name of the language, framework, or etc that you are working on.</li>
  <li>Organise all TILs into folders. No loose files.</li>
</ol>
